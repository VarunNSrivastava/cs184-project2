<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    For this project, I've implemented 2D and 3D mesh structures. In particular, in the first part, I've implemented
    Bezier Curves and Surfaces with adjustable vertices. In the second part, I've extended these to give support for
    area-weighted normals and general mesh loop subdivison. In the context of a 3D modeling
    software such as Autodesk Maya, these features can be considered akin to "smooth mode" and adding edge loops,
    respectively.

</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<p>
    Bezier Curves are used to express smooth curves without the need of explicit formula, and rather a set of control points.
    Two of these control points act as endpoints, while the remaining control points act as
    "weights". One useful analogy for these intermediary points is as sources of gravity to which the curve is attracted to.
</p>
    <br>
    <!-- 6 point fully evaluated curve  -->
    <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/pt1_1.jpeg" align="middle" width="50%">
    </div>
    <br>
<p>

    Another formulation of Bezier Curves is via De Casteljau's algorithm, which expresses each point on the curve in terms
    of the outcome of repeated linear interpolation across each control point. In particular, each iteration of interpolation
    calculates the weighted midpoint of the control point (for some weight parameter \(t\)). The midpoints are treated
    as the next set of control points for the next layer of interpolation. This process is repeated until we only have a single
    point remaining. As we range \(t\)  from 0 to 1, we can produce every single point on the curve.

    Here is an example of how the curve changes when we move control points slightly.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>

<p>
    We can extend our implementation from 2D to 3D by interpolating over dimensions. In particular, if we have a \(n \times n\) grid
    of 3D control points, we can reduce this to a \(n \times 1\) vector of control points by applying de Casteljau's algorithm
    over one of the dimensions. Then we can turn this vector into a single point by another round of the algorithm. Now we can
    create elaborate 3D meshes:
</p>

<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>


<p>
    In order to smooth the appearance of the mesh, we use Phong shading to interpolate the color at a given pixel, instead
    of shading an entire face with the same color. This requires knowing the normal vector at any vertex on the mesh. Since
    the normal vector of a point is undefined, we instead approximate this value by calculating the weighted average
    of normals of all adjacent faces to the vertex. In practice, this is very simple since the normal vector of a triangle
    proportional to its area is given by the cross product of two of its edges.
</p>
    <br>

    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">

            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
    <br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<p>
    The Edge Flip operation swaps which diagonal is splitting a given quadrilateral. In practice, all that needs to be
    done here is the systematic re-assigning of pointers. We simply keep track of all the vertices, half-edges, edges,
    and faces in the original quadrilateral, and then reassign them as specified by a edge flip. Solving this for the
    simplest case (e.g. two triangles joined by a single edge) suffices to solve it in general.
</p>
    <br>
    <!-- Flipping some edges on the teapot -->
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt4_1.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>Before edge flips</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt4_2.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>After some edge flips</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
    <br>

<p>
    The implementation of edge flips was relatively straightforward and we did not encounter much difficulty here.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

<p>
    The Edge Split operation takes an edge corresponding to the diagonal of a quadrilateral and initializes the opposite diagonal.
    In practice, this is more difficult than edge flipping since several new objects must be initialized. In my implementation,
    six new half-edges, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and 1 new vertex are created in a single call the edge split. Keeping track of pointers
    requires some precision.
</p>
<br>


    <!-- Edge splits on some mesh-->
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt5_1.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>Before edge splits</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt5_2.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>After some edge splits</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>

    <!-- Edge splits & flips on some mesh-->
    <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/pt5_3.jpeg" align="middle" width="50%">
        <figcaption>Edge splits <i>and</i> flips on a mesh.</figcaption>

    </div>


<p>
    Implementing edge splits required some debugging. In particular, in our initial implementation, one face would always
    vanish after performing edge splitting. This problem was caused by the incorrect assignment of one of the faces,
    which was a problem that took some time to discover.
</p>
<br>



<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>
    Loop subdivision is the technique used to upsample a given mesh; e.g., increase the number of polygons. Loop subdivision
    essentially just turns each triangle into four, and then slightly adjusts the position of each resultant vertex. This is difficult
    because of the number of pointers that must be managed when dividing an entire mesh. In practice, this process
    is equivalent to edge splitting every edge, and then flipping each of the (two) new edges created per split.
</p>
<br>
    <!--Some loop subdivisions // torus?-->
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_1.jpeg" align="middle" width="200px"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_2.jpeg" align="middle" width="200px"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_3.jpeg" align="middle" width="200px"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_4.jpeg" align="middle" width="200px"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_5.jpeg" align="middle" width="200px"/>
                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
    <br>
<p>
    In code, this algorithm was implemented in three major steps.
    <ol>
        <li>Compute the final positions of each existing vertex in the mesh, as well each of the new vertices that will be created.
        Store these values in the data structures of the existing vertices and edges, but do not assign them yet.</li>
        <li>Edge split each vertex. Ensure that we keep track of which edges are new and which are old, for the next step.
        Additionally, we can now assign the new positions for each of the vertices.</li>
        <li>Flip each new edge.</li>
    </ol>
    In total, this implementation requires two passes through each edge of the original mesh, and one pass through the
    edges of the upsampled mesh.

</p>
    <br>
<p>
    This \(4-1\) subdivision comes with some consequences. In particular, (1) sharp edges are severely rounded out, and (2) the
    upsampled mesh is completely dependent on the topology of the mesh rather than its geometry. We can see observe of these
    effects when upsampling the mesh of a cube:
</p>

            <tr align="center">

                </td>

                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
<br>


    <!--asymmetry on cube-->
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_8.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/pt6_9.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>

            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
    <br>
<br>



<p>
    It turns out, both of these effects can be alleviated by pre-processing. To solve (1), we can add more edge loops
    around sharp corners in order to encourage them to stay sharp after upsampling:
</p>
<br>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">

                    <img src="images/pt6_10.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                    <figcaption>Adding some edges near the corner we want to preserve</figcaption>

                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </div>
    <br>

<p>
    On the other hand, in we can fix our asymmetry problem by ensuring that the toplogy of the cube reflects the symmetry
    we would like to be present in the geometry of the cube. That is, we will create additional edges so that our cube
    has complete symmetry.
</p>
<br>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">

<p>
    Of course, the implementation of upsampling was not without bugs. One such bug we encounter was mistakenly flipping
    every single edge on the mesh after splitting, rather than only splitting the desired edges. This created some
    interesting results!
</p>

    <p>
       We also chose to implement another subdivsion; in particular, the \(\sqrt{3}\)-algorithm as described in
        <a href="https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/sqrt31.pdf">this paper.</a> This algorithm is
        fairly simple; we simply insert a new vertex in the exact center of each triangle, and then we "relax" all the
        surrounding vertices. The formula for relaxing each vertex is a weighted average of the neighboring vertices
        and the original position and the new midpoints, with a formula provided in the paper. This method has
        advantages of simpler implementation than the \(4-1\) algorithm, and "usually needs fewer triangles and
        less effort to achieve the same approximation
        tolerance." Here is an example of some subdivisions of the bean mesh using this algorithm:

    <br>
    <p>
        We're not confident our implementation is correct as we have no reference images to compare.
        In fact, it does appear that our implementation has very obvious flaws, in that it emphasizes all the
        original triangles in the topology:
